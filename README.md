# React Problems Project

This project is a collection of coding problems implemented using **React** and **Vite**, with environment variables managed via a local `.env` file. Each problem is organized in its own folder under `src`, with a dedicated `README.md` file explaining the problem and its solution. The project is built and deployed to [URL X](https://example.com).
## Deployment

All problems are deployed at [https://99techteam-code-challenge-flax.vercel.app/](https://99techteam-code-challenge-flax.vercel.app/).

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains individual folders for each problem ( following the folder structure mentioned in Code Challenge).
  - Each problem folder includes:
    - Source code for the solution.
    - A `README.md` with problem description and implementation details.
- **.env**: Local environment file for configuration (not tracked in Git).

## Problems

Below is a list of problems included in this project, with links to their respective GitHub folders:

**[Problem 1](https://github.com/gilovino92/99techteam-code-challenge/tree/main/src/problem1)**  

**[Problem 2](https://github.com/gilovino92/99techteam-code-challenge/tree/main/src/problem2)**  

**[Problem 3](https://github.com/gilovino92/99techteam-code-challenge/tree/main/src/problem3)**  

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gilovino92/99techteam-code-challenge.git
   cd repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_KEY=your_key`).

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Preview the production build**:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed via `.env` for local configuration.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for additional problems or improvements. Ensure each new problem is placed in its own folder under `src` with a `README.md` describing the problem and solution.
